# Simple Expo Build Upload to Revyl
#
# This workflow demonstrates the simplest way to integrate Revyl into your Expo project:
# 1. Build your app with Expo EAS
# 2. Upload the build to Revyl for storage and future testing
#
# Perfect for teams that want to:
# - Store builds automatically in Revyl
# - Run tests manually later
# - Get started with minimal setup

name: Upload Expo Build to Revyl

# When this workflow runs:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # Run when code is pushed to main branch
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering from GitHub UI

jobs:
  upload-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Environment variables - these are used throughout the workflow
    env:
      # 🔑 REQUIRED: Your Revyl API key (set in GitHub repository secrets)
      # Get this from: https://auth.revyl.ai/account/api_keys
      REVYL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.REVYL_API_KEY }}

      # 🔑 REQUIRED: Your Expo access token (set in GitHub repository secrets)
      # Get this from: https://expo.dev/accounts/[username]/settings/access-tokens
      EXPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      # 🏗️ REQUIRED: Replace with your Revyl build variable ID
      # Get this from your Revyl dashboard when you create a build variable
      BUILD_VAR_ID: 'your-build-variable-id-here' # 📝 UPDATE THIS

      # 🏷️ Version naming - using git commit SHA for uniqueness
      # You can customize this format (e.g., v1.0.${{ github.run_number }})
      VERSION: ${{ github.sha }}

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get your source code from the repository
      - name: 📥 Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment for your Expo project
      - name: 🟢 Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18.x' # Use Node.js 18 (recommended for Expo)
          cache: npm # Cache npm dependencies to speed up future runs

      # Step 3: Set up Expo CLI and EAS CLI for building
      - name: 🚀 Setup Expo and EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest # Always use the latest EAS CLI
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }} # Authenticate with your Expo account

      # Step 4: Install your project's dependencies
      - name: 📦 Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci # Use 'npm ci' for faster, reliable installs in CI

      # Step 5: Build your app with EAS (this is where the magic happens!)
      - name: 🏗️ Build iOS App with EAS
        run: |
          echo "🍎 Starting iOS build with EAS..."

          # Build with EAS and capture the JSON response using these flags
          # --platform ios: Build for iOS
                      # --profile preview: Use the 'preview' build profile (change if you use different profile, but ENSURE this is a SIMULATOR build profile)
            # See ExpoiOS.png in this folder for how to configure your EAS profile for simulator builds
          # --non-interactive: Don't prompt for user input
          # --wait: Wait for the build to complete before continuing
          # --json: Return response in JSON format for easier parsing
          BUILD_JSON=$(eas build --platform ios --profile preview --non-interactive --wait --json)

          # Extract the download URL from the EAS response
          # This URL points to the .tar.gz file containing your iOS .app
          BUILD_URL=$(echo "$BUILD_JSON" | jq -r '.[0].artifacts.buildUrl')

          echo "✅ Build completed! Download URL: $BUILD_URL"

          # Make the URL available to subsequent steps
          echo "BUILD_URL=$BUILD_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      # Step 6: Upload your build to Revyl (the main event!)
      - name: ⬆️ Upload Build to Revyl
        uses: RevylAI/revyl-gh-action/upload-build@main
        with:
          # Which Revyl build variable to upload to
          build-var-id: ${{ env.BUILD_VAR_ID }}

          # Version identifier for this build (must be unique)
          version: ${{ env.VERSION }}

          # URL to download the build from (EAS provides this)
          expo-url: ${{ env.BUILD_URL }}

          # Headers needed to download from EAS (includes your auth token)
          expo-headers: '{"Authorization": "Bearer ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}"}'

        # 🎯 What this step does behind the scenes:
        # ✅ Downloads the .tar.gz file from Expo
        # ✅ Extracts the .app file from the archive
        # ✅ Converts it to .zip format (required by Revyl)
        # ✅ Extracts the app's bundle identifier (package ID)
        # ✅ Uploads to Revyl with automatic CI/CD metadata like:
        #    - commit_sha: ${{ github.sha }}
        #    - branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
        #    - ci_run_url: Link to this GitHub Actions run
        #    - ci_system: "github-actions"
        # ✅ Returns a version-id that you can use for testing later

      # 🎊 That's it! Your build is now stored in Revyl and ready for testing.
      #
      # Next steps you might want to add:
      # - Add a step to run tests using the uploaded build
      # - Post a comment to PRs with the build information
      # - Send notifications to Slack/Teams
      # - Deploy to app stores if tests pass
