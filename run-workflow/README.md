# Run Revyl Workflow Action

A dedicated entrypoint for executing a Revyl workflow by `workflow-id`, with real-time monitoring and workflow-focused outputs. This is a thin wrapper around the core runner to provide a clear, separate interface from tests.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Run Revyl Workflow
  uses: RevylAI/revyl-gh-action/run-workflow@v1
  with:
    workflow-id: 'your-workflow-id'
    timeout: '3600'
  env:
    REVYL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.REVYL_API_KEY }}
```

### Scheduled monitoring example

```yaml
name: Revyl Workflow Monitoring
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # hourly

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Execute workflow
        uses: RevylAI/revyl-gh-action/run-workflow@v1
        with:
          workflow-id: 'your-workflow-id'
          timeout: '3600'
        env:
          REVYL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.REVYL_MONITORING_API_KEY }}
```

- Pin to a release (e.g., `@v1`) or a commit SHA for stability.
